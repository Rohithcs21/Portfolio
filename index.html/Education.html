        SRI SHAILESHWARA VIDYA KENDRA is a house of learning based on academics and on values. In this pursuit, we integrate traditional modes of learning with the newly emerged e-learning. We take care to see that the qualities of the heart are not swamped by those of the mind.

With a team of well qualified, experienced and dedicated staff, training is imparted by using modern techniques and technology. The school library and information centre, modernized computer lab, and well equipped Science labs, help scholars to develop a spirit of research, a sense of independent work and a high level of academic achievement.
